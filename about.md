I am a final year student of Electrical Engineering at [IIT(BHU), Varanasi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/) in Uttar Pradesh, India. I am enrolled in the Integrated Dual-Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) 5-year programme here. 

I'm currently spending my summer interning at [Openstack](https://www.openstack.org/) as a part of a programme called [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/). The project that I am working on is 'Extend sushy to support RAID for Redfish'. 

My main areas of interest are in Cloud Computing, Distributed Systems and Parallel Computing.
